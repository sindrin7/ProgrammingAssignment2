## The function is to compute the inverse of a square matrix can be done with 
## the solve function in R. 

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can 
## cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}

## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the 
## inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
