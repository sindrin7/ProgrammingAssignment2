## The function is to compute the inverse of a square matrix can be done with 
## the solve function in R. 

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can 
## cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        s <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                s <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() s
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve,
             getsolve = getsolve)   
}

## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the 
## inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        s <- x$getsolve()
        if(!is.null(s)) {
                message("Getting cached data")
                return(s)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        s <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setsolve(s)
        s
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
